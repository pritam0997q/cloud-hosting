# Cloud Hosting Lab – Personal Projects

This repository documents my experiments and tests using cloud infrastructure platforms like Linode, Google Cloud, and Azure. My primary goals are:

- 🖥️ Setting up GPU-enabled virtual machines
- 🎮 Hosting and managing Minecraft servers
- 📹 Testing game streaming tools like OBS and Moonlight
- 🧪 Exploring Windows virtualization and RDP performance in the cloud

## Purpose

This is a personal learning and testing project. I'm not affiliated with any company or business. My intent is to gain hands-on experience with cloud computing for game hosting and development tools.
